    down his face.


    "Oh the tragedy! My poor Fluffums, stolen away before my
    very eyes. Please oh please good sir. You must put an end to the tyranny of the
    rat king!"


    The noble begs the aid of your guild. This might be a good chance
    to spread your name a bit, but is your lone adventurer up for the challenge?'
